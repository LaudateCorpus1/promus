What is Promus?
***************

Promus is a remote manager designed to create and manage `git
<http://git-scm.com/>`_ repositories in a remote server without the
need of administrator privileges. It was designed with the goal of
creating your own private repositories in a server to which you have
access. It allows you to create connections to remote servers between
you and your collaborators via `ssh keys
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Key_management>`_.

Promus is your personal blutler. You let promus send invitation to
your collaborators so that they may access your account via ssh keys
and you specify in each of the repositories an access control list
(acl) in you write down the names of the administrators for the
repositories (who have more control over the project) and users.
