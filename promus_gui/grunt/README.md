This is a collection of `less` files and `javascript` files to
generate single minified versions of `css` and `javascript` files.

Quick start
-----------

To be able to obtain the css and javascript files that are used by
`promus-gui` we need to perform several installation if you do not
have them already installed.

Install Grunt
+++++++++++++

First you need to install `Node.js`. To do so go to
<http://nodejs.org/download/> and select the package for your
operating system. Or, if you have an installer like `brew` in OS X
you can do:

    brew install npm

Once that is done it is time to install `grunt`.

From the command line enter

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Once grunt is available you can do `npm install` in the directory
containing `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js`. This will read the file
`package.json` and install the grunt dependencies under the
`node_modules` directory.

Generating the files
++++++++++++++++++++

First you need to rename the file `less/pkgname.less` to whatever you
have named your project. That is, the name specified in
`package.json`.

To generate the css and javascript files call `grunt`. The files
generated by will be placed in `<dest>/css` and `<dest>/js` where
<dest> is specified `Gruntfile.js` under `grunt.initConfig`.

More `javascript`
+++++++++++++++++

Place your javascript files under the `js` directory and add the file
to `Gruntfile.js`. The name should be placed somewhere under
`grunt.initConfig['concat']['pkgname']['src']`.

More `less`
+++++++++++

Create more `less` files under the `less` directory but do not forget
to add them to the file `less/pkgname.less`. This file should have
been renamed to your package name.
